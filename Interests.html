      <H2> Sports </H2>
      <H4> My favorite sports are baseball, basketball, and soccer. The only sport from these three that I acually play is baseball I mostly like watching soccer and basketball. I began playing baseball when I was in middle school and kept playing until high school. When I was younger I was completly into soccer and said that I was going to become a soccer player when I was older but then I saw baseball and found a new love. Basketball was a sport that I picked up recently but, I have beome a huge fan and now watch games all of the time. Soccer as well I love watching soccer games and seeing amazing goals. My favorite teams include, The Philadelphia 76ers, San Francisco giants, Manchester City, and FC Barcelona.
