      <H1> My Background </H1>
      <H2> Family</H2>
      <H4> I have what I would say is a pretty normal family. I have a mother, a father, three sisters and a cat named Tom. My oldst sister is going to college in Orange County and is currently in her third year attending there. My second youngest sister goes to Miller Creek Middle School and is in her 7th grade, and the youngest is going to Mary E. Silveira Elementary School and is in the 1st grade.

      <H2> Birth/ Intresting Story</H2>
      <H4> I was born localy in the Marin General Hospital, was born a pretty normal baby and with no complications at birth. As for my intresting story I want to tell you about my first pet. I prabobly like in the 6th grade when I recived my first ever pet it was a lepord Gecko that had the cutes smile I had ever seen in my life. His name was Crawls, and I loved him like he was a family member. Issue was that family members and friends would want to touch him and carry him and once Crawls would be in there hands they would flinch and send him flying towards the ground. The poor animal ended up injuring two of his arms and it became clear to see that movment was becoming an issue to him. As I would put crikets in his tank he wouldn't strike at them like before and chace them down dead but, worst of all he didn't have that amazing smile any longer. It brought sadness to my heart as I had to let him go but, seeming him like that was torture to my heart the thought of not having him with me was disquieting and distressing but, in the end I learned that all good things must come to an end.
